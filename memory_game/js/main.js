// The instructions were very unclear here especially towards the end. I don't know any of the values and page 6
// Project:functions didnt give any specifics that I could comprehend. I feel the same way fot the first function up top.
//Css and HTML were very well detailed while java had 1 minute videos, i feel it should 100% be the other way around.
//I would really appreciate more videos or spoken word audio files to guide me through this, as I have used youtube more than the cheatsheets or anything else given in the pre-work and still haven't grasped the subject.
